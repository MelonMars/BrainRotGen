# BrainRot Gen

This is a simple BrainRot generator. It currently is designed to make those weird videos. You supply videos to it and text to it and it will generate an output video from it.

Currently it is functioning at: [Firebase](). ***Please*** try to be soft with my server, it's not free for me. And be *very* patient, it takes a while.

If my instance doesn't work for a while, check the console, and if there's an error about the compose, then message me (@Carter Pfaff on Slack) and try running it yourself -- my server is the problem.

## Run for yourself:
Install ImageMagick, and find the path to either `convert` or to `imagemagick.exe`
```bash
python api.py IMAGEMAGICKPATH # Replace IMAGEMAGICKPATH with the path to the ImageMagick executable
```
You can then find a webserver of your liking (I've been using the built in WebStorm webserver) and open the index.html file

##### Currently it does not support the AI features, as I'm having problem with my credits, but it will when I fix those. On my computer the AI works.
